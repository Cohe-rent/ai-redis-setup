# Redis Setup

This setup was AI-generated using OpenRouter and the meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct model.

```
Here is the Docker Compose configuration file to run Redis in a container with persistent volume, default port 6379 exposed to the host, and basic authentication enabled:

```
version: '3'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./redis-data:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=your_secret_password
      - REDIS_REQUIREPASS=yes
```

Please replace `your_secret_password` with a strong password of your choice to enable basic authentication.

Note: The `redis-data` volume will persist the Redis data even after the container is stopped or removed. If you want to specify a specific directory on the host machine, replace `./redis-data` with the path to that directory.
```
