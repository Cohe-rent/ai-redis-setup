Here are examples of production-grade infrastructure code for deploying Redis using Docker Compose and Kubernetes:

**Docker Compose**

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following contents:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  redis:
    image: redis:6.2-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data

volumes:
  redis-data:
    driver: local
    driver_opts:
      type: none
      device: ${PWD}/redis-data
      o: bind
```
This configuration:

* Uses the `redis:6.2-alpine` image
* Maps port 6379 on the container to port 6379 on the host machine
* Sets the `restart` policy to `always` to ensure Redis restarts automatically if the container crashes or is terminated
* Mounts a volume named `redis-data` to persist data even if the container is restarted or deleted
* Uses the `local` driver to mount the volume, which is stored in a directory named `redis-data` in the current working directory

**Kubernetes**

Create a file named `redis-deployment.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:6.2-alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 6379
        volumeMounts:
        - name: redis-data
          mountPath: /data
      volumes:
      - name: redis-data
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: redis-data-pvc
```
This configuration:

* Defines a Deployment named `redis` with one replica
* Specifies the `redis:6.2-alpine` image
* Exposes port 6379 on the container
* Mounts a volume named `redis-data` to the `/data` directory in the container
* References a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) named `redis-data-pvc` to persist data

Create a file named `redis-pvc.yaml` with the following contents:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: redis-data-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```
This configuration:

* Defines a PVC named `redis-data-pvc` that requests 1 GiB of storage
* Specifies `ReadWriteOnce` access mode, which allows a single node to read and write to the persistent volume

Apply the configurations using the following commands:
```
docker-compose up -d
kubectl apply -f redis-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis-pvc.yaml
```
Best practices and notes:

* Use a consistent naming convention for services, deployments, and volumes to avoid conflicts and make it easier to manage and debug your infrastructure.
* Use persistent volumes or stateful sets to persist data even if the container is restarted or deleted.
* Use a load balancer or service discovery mechanism to distribute traffic and ensure high availability.
* Monitor and log your Redis instance using tools like Redis Sentinel, Redis CLI, or third-party monitoring and logging solutions.
* Regularly backup and restore your Redis data to ensure data integrity and availability.

Remember to adjust the configuration files according to your specific use case and requirements.
