Here is the Docker Compose configuration you requested:
```
version: '3'
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
    volumes:
      - redis-data:/data
    environment:
      - REDIS_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword
    restart: always

volumes:
  redis-data:
```
Let me explain what each part of this configuration does:

* `version`: specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
* `services`: defines the services (containers) that will be created.
* `redis`: defines a service named `redis` that uses the `redis:alpine` image.
* `ports`: maps port 6379 in the container to port 6379 on the host machine, allowing you to access Redis from the host.
* `volumes`: mounts a persistent volume named `redis-data` to the `/data` directory in the container. This allows data to be persisted even if the container is restarted or deleted.
* `environment`: sets an environment variable `REDIS_PASSWORD` to `mysecretpassword`. This is used to enable basic authentication for Redis.
* `restart`: specifies that the container should be restarted if it exits or crashes.

The `volumes` section defines a named volume `redis-data` that is used to persist data even if the container is restarted or deleted. The `volumes` section is defined outside of the `services` section, so that it can be used by multiple services if needed.
